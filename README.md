# hello-world
A place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.

benpak reporting for duty. My desire is to learn and practice Web Development over the course of a month.
I will achieve this by completing at least 1 section of The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course each day.

By the end of a month, on 7/21/17, I will have practiced for over 50 hours and have a fully-functioning website.
